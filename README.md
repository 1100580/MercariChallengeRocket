# MercariChallengeRocket

## Final Idea
Training an image recognition algorithm to extract information and give insight about a product someone wants to sell in a Mercari-style website. Example: Someone uploads a picture of a red shirt. 
-The app should auto-fill the data it feels confidence about (i.e. 95% certain it's a clothing category item, 99% sure it is red)
-And give insight about what sells when it comes to clothing items (i.e. "Shirts on Mercari sell 75% faster if they have a size and brand filled. Is this a [Insert guessed brand here] shirt?", "You can beat 97% of listing prices for red t-shirts if you price it under 26â‚¬", etc.)
